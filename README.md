# Binary Search Trees 🌳

### About 📖

Binary search trees are a data structure that allow for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations

Eight project of the JavaScript chapter in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)

### Methods 🔧

`buildTree()` Builds the tree from a sorted array

`prettyPrint()` Prints the tree in a visually appealing format

`insert(value)` Inserts a value into the BST

`delete(value)` Deletes a value from the BST

`find(value)` Finds and returns the node containing the given value in the BST

`levelOrder()` Performs a breadth-first traversal and calls the function passed as argument with each node as it's argument

`inorder()` Performs an in-order traversal and calls the function passed as argument with each node as it's argument

`preorder()` Performs a pre-order traversal and calls the function passed as argument with each node as it's argument

`postorder()` Performs a post-order traversal and calls the function passed as argument with each node as it's argument

`height()` Returns the height

`isBalanced()` Checks if the BST is balanced

`rebalance()` Rebalances an unbalanced BST
