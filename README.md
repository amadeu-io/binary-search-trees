# BSTs 🌳

### About 📖

BSTs are a data structure that allow for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

Eight project of the JavaScript chapter in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

### Methods 🔧

#### `buildTree(sortedArray)`

Builds the tree from a sorted array

#### `prettyPrint()`

Prints the tree in a visually appealing format

#### `insert(value)`

Inserts a value into the BST

#### `delete(value)`

Deletes a value from the BST

#### `find(value)`

Finds and returns the node containing the given value in the BST

#### `levelOrder()`

Performs a breadth-first traversal of the BST and returns an array containing the values of the nodes in level order.

#### `inorder()`

Performs an in-order traversal of the BST and returns an array containing the values of the nodes in in-order.

#### `preorder()`

Performs a pre-order traversal of the BST and returns an array containing the values of the nodes in pre-order.

#### `postorder()`

Performs a post-order traversal of the BST and returns an array containing the values of the nodes in post-order.

#### `height()`

Returns the height of the BST, which is the maximum number of edges in the longest path from the root to a leaf node.

#### `isBalanced()`

Checks if the BST is balanced, i.e., the heights of the left and right subtrees differ by at most 1.

#### `rebalance()`

Rebalances an unbalanced BST by reconstructing it with a new balanced structure.
