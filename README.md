# Binary Search Trees 🌳

### About 📖

Binary search trees are a data structure that allow for efficient search, insertion, and deletion. When the tree is balanced, these operations have a time complexity of `O(logn)`, which is way better than the one of a regular list `O(n)`.

Eight project of the JavaScript chapter in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

### Methods 🔧

- 🌳 `buildTree()`: Builds the tree from a sorted array.

- 🌿 `prettyPrint()`: Prints the tree in a visually appealing format.

- ➕ `insert(value)`: Inserts a value.

- ➖ `delete(value)`: Deletes a value.

- 🔍 `find(value)`: Finds and returns the node containing the given value.

- 🌐 `levelOrder()`: Performs a breadth-first traversal and calls the function passed as an argument with each node as its argument.

- ⏭️ `inorder()`: Performs an in-order traversal and calls the function passed as an argument with each node as its argument.

- ⏯️ `preorder()`: Performs a pre-order traversal and calls the function passed as an argument with each node as its argument.

- ⏮️ `postorder()`: Performs a post-order traversal and calls the function passed as an argument with each node as its argument.

- 📏 `height()`: Returns the height of the BST.

- ⚖️ `isBalanced()`: Checks if the BST is balanced.

- ⚖️ `rebalance()`: Rebalances an unbalanced BST.
