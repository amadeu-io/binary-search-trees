# BSTs 🌳

### About 📖

BSTs are a data structure that allow for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

Eight project of the JavaScript chapter in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

### Methods 🔧

```buildTree()``` Builds the tree from a sorted array

`prettyPrint()` Prints the tree in a visually appealing format

`insert(value)` Inserts a value into the BST

`delete(value)` Deletes a value from the BST

`find(value)` Finds and returns the node containing the given value in the BST

`levelOrder()` Performs a breadth-first traversal and calls the function passed as argument with each node as it's argument

`inorder()` Performs an in-order traversal and calls the function passed as argument with each node as it's argument

`preorder()` Performs a pre-order traversal and calls the function passed as argument with each node as it's argument

`postorder()` Performs a post-order traversal and calls the function passed as argument with each node as it's argument

`height()` Returns the height, defined as the maximum number of edges in the longest path from the root to a leaf node

`isBalanced()` Checks if the BST is balanced, i.e., the heights of the left and right subtrees differ by at most 1

`rebalance()` Rebalances an unbalanced BST by reconstructing it with a new balanced structure
